# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert the Spotify data into. 
# Last but not least, I perfomed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.


#1 What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name


#2 What is the average popularoty by artitst and track?
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name


#3 Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10


#4 What's the average danceability for thw 10 most popular songs? 
SELECT 
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
